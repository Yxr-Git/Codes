Reversi(or Othello)

Reversi
Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8¡Á8 uncheckered board. There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks, which are white on one side and black on the other. Players take turns placing discs on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any discs of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disc just placed and another disc of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.

Rules
Reversi starts with an empty board, and the first two moves by each player are in the four central squares of the board;
